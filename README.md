## II-About the project:
⚡The Case given by the company was made in accordance with Object Oriented Programming (OOP) using the Java language 
because there was a specific language request from us in the Case given by the company.

⚡Since a specific framework was not specified in the test cases given as an example, our tests were run in the Junit framework.

⚡Nothing much was done by adhering to the Case that was asked to be done one-on-one.

⚡In order to conveniently check that the verification steps have taken place, the output has been taken on the console.

⚡With the created reusable methods, it was aimed to comply with the solid principles of the project.
